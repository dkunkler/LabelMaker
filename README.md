# LabelMaker
Creates labels in a repo. Useful for shared labels across repos.

If label already exists, it let's you know, but it is possible to end up with duplicate colors.

Props to @jssjr for the source. 

Requires a Ruby environment and Octokit

Uses GH_USER and GH_TOKEN for authorized repo access. Works in bash or zsh

Your token must have appropriate permissions, and you must have contributor access to the repo in which you plan to add labels.

## Detailed instructions:

First, choose which shell you plan to run the script from, bash or zsh

From your shell, check if you already have ruby installed:

  `ruby -v`

If you don't have ruby, install:

  `brew install ruby`


If you don't have octokit, install:   
  `sudo gem install octokit`    
(it will ask for your computer password, not GitHub password)

Now that you have ruby, youâ€™ll need to set up certificates so the script will have permission to add labels to your repos.

  * Developer Settings.  
  * Personal access tokens.  
  * Generate new token.  
    * Add a note so you know how you plan to use this token, e.g. Label Maker.  
    * **Under Select Scopes, check `repo` box, in order to edit private repos.**  
  * Generate token.  
COPY THE GENERATED TOKEN, so you can access it below, and in the future.

**Note, you will only be able to edit labels in repos for which you have permissions as a contributor.**

To use the newly created token:

	for bash, create or edit the following file:
	/Users/<username>/.bash_profile

	for zsh, create or edit the following file:
	/Users/<username>/.zprofile

in either file, add the following lines:

  `export GH_USER=<username>`
  
  `export GH_TOKEN=<generated token value>`

Clone or download the label-maker.rb script.  
Edit `label-maker.rb`

configure the LABELS names and colors you want to inject into a repo   
Save it

From your shell, navigate to the label-maker.rb directory

`ruby label-maker.rb github/<repo name>`
or  
`ruby label-maker.rb <username>/<repo name>`

Repeat for each repo
