# LabelMaker
Creates labels in any repo. Useful for shared labels across repos.

If label already exists, it let's you know, but it is possible to end up with duplicate colors.

Props to @jssjr for the source. 

Requires a Ruby environment. 

Uses GH_USER and GH_TOKEN for authorized repo access. Works in bash or zsh
